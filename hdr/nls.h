/*
 *	Description of the organization of NLS information -- 2000/02/13 ska
 *
 *	Glossar:
 *	NLS package -- NLS information incl. any code required to access or
 *		correctly interprete this particular information
 *
 *	Abbreviation:
 *	(NLS) pkg -- NLS package
 *
 *	The code included into the kernel does "only" support NLS packages
 *	structurally compatible with the one of the U.S.A. / CP437.
 *	I guess that most NLS packages has been tweaked to be compatible
 *	so that this is not a real limitation, but for all other packages
 *	the external NLSFUNC can supply every piece of code necessary.
 *	To allow this the interface between the kernel and NLSFUNC has been
 *	extended; at same time the interface has been reduced, because some
 *	of the API functions do not seem to offer any functionality required
 *	for now. This, however, may be a misinterpretation because of
 *	lack of understanding.
 *	
 *	The supported structure consists of the following assumptions:
 *	1) The pkg must contain the tables 2 (Upcase character), 4
 *		(Upcase filename character) and 5 (filename termination
 *		characters); because they are internally used.
 *	2) The tables 2 and 4 must contain exactly 128 (0x80) characters.
 *		The character at index 0 corresponses to character 128 (0x80).
 *		The characters in the range of 0..0x7f are constructed out of
 *		the 7-bit US-ASCII (+ control characters) character set and are
 *		upcased not through the table, but by the expression:
 *			(ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z')? ch - 'a' + 'A': ch
 *			with: 'a' == 97; 'z' == 122; 'A' == 65
 *
 *	It seems that pure DOS can internally maintain two NLS pkgs:
 *	NLS#1: The hardcoded pkg of U.S.A. on CP437, and
 *	NLS#2: the pkg loaded via COUNTRY= from within CONFIG.SYS.
 *	I do interprete this behaviour as follows:
 *	CONFIG.SYS is read in more passes; before COUTRY= can be evaluated,
 *	many actions must be performed, e.g. to load kernel at all, open
 *	CONFIG.SYS and begin reading. The kernel requires at least one
 *	NLS information _before_ COUNTRY= has been evaluated - the upcase
 *	table. To not implement the same function multiple times, e.g.
 *	to upcase with and without table, the kernel uses the default
 *	NLS pkg until a more appropriate can be loaded and hopes that
 *	the BIOS (and the user) can live with its outcome.
 *	Though, theoretically, the hardcoded NLS pkg could be purged
 *	or overwritten once the COUNTRY= statement has been evaluated.
 *	It would be possible that this NLS pkg internally performs different
 *	purposes, for now this behaviour will be kept.
 *
 *	The current implementation extendeds the above "two maintained
 *	NLS pkgs" into that the kernel chains all NLS pkgs loaded in
 *	memory into one single linked list. When the user does neither
 *	wants to load other NLS pkgs without executing NLSFUNC and the
 *	loaded NLS pkgs do not contain code themselves, no other code is
 *	required, but some memory to store the NLS pkgs into.
 *
 *	Furthermore, because the kernel needs to include the code for the
 *	hardcoded NLS pkg anyway, every NLS pkg can use it; so only
 *	NLS pkgs that structurally differ from U.S.A./CP437 actually need
 *	to add any code and residently install the MUX handler for NLSFUNC.
 *	This technique reduces the overhead calling the MUX handler, when
 *	it is not needed.
 *	
 *	The kernel can be instructed to pass any subfunction of DOS-65 to
 *	MUX-14-02, including the character upcase subfunctions 0x20-0x22 and
 *	0xA0-0xA2 as well as 0x23 (yes/no response). That way upcase table can
 *	be supported (by reducing performance) that do not contain exactly 128
 *	characters or where the lower portion is not constructed from the 7-bit
 *	US-ASCII character set.
 *	To do so, each NLS pkg contains some flags specifying if to pass a
 *	set of subfunctions to MUX-14-02, the sets include:
 *		set#1: filename character upcase 0xA0-0xA2
 *		set#2: character upcase 0x20-0x22
 *		set#3: yes/no response 0x23
 *		set#4: Extended Country Information (Includes DOS-38)
 *		set#5: Anything else (usually picks a pointer from an array)
 *
 *	Win9x supports to change the individual portions of a NLS pkg
 *	through DOS-65-00; also there are no references what happens when
 *	a program changes the areas addressed by returned pointers. The
 *	current implementation does _not_ support changes of the NLS pkg
 *	except by invoking DOS-38 (Set Country Code) or DOS-66 (Set Codepage).
 *	Future implementations might offer this ability; to reduce the
 *	overhead introduced by this feature, the macro NLS_MODIFYABLE_DATA
 *	enables the appropriate code.
 *	NLS_MODIFYABLE_DATA is *disabled* by default.
 *
 *	The tables 2 and 4 (upcase tables) are relatively accessed often,
 *	but theoretically these tables could be loacted at any position
 *	of the pointer array. If the macro NLS_REORDER_POINTERS is enabled,
 *	both NLSFUNC and the internal loader will reorder the pointers
 *	array so that mandatory tables are located at predictable indexes.
 *	This removes that the kernel must search for the table when
 *	one of the DOS-65-[2A]x function is called or a filename has been
 *	passed in (which must be uppercased to be suitable for internal
 *	purpose). However, when some program try to tweak the internal
 *	tables this assumption could be wrong.
 *	NLS_REORDER_POINTERS is *enabled* by default.
 *
 *	A second performance boost can be achieved, if the kernel shall
 *	support *only* NLS pkgs that apply to the structure mentioned above,
 *	thus, contain only characters 0x80-0xFF and the range 0x00-0x7F
 *	is upcased as 7-bit US-ASCII. In this case when upcasing the
 *	NLS pkg is bypassed at all, but cached pointers are used, which
 *	point directly to the upcased characters. Because I don't know
 *	existing NLS pkgs, this feature may be not very trustworthy; also
 *	when the NLS pkg is switched bypassing DOS, the cached pointers
 *	won't be updated, also by enabling this macro the MUX-flags are
 *	ignored for the sub-functions DOS-65-[2A][0-2], therefore:
 *	NLS_CACHE_POINTERS is *disabled* by default.
