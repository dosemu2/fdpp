/*
 *	Description of the algorithm the COUNTRY= information is loaded.

1) LoadCountry() is activated in pass 1, because it offers the functionality
how to upcase characters to the kernel, it should be activated as
soon as possible within processing CONFIG.SYS.

2) The method to locate the actual data within COUNTRY.SYS is pretty
basic and straight forward; so no detailed description here.

3) To reduce permanent memory useage the option NLS_MODIFYABLE_DATA
controls whether or not the loaded NLS pkg may be modified. By default,
modifying this data is _not_ supported.
The reason is to allow to re-use already loaded data, e.g. to use the
same physical table for #2 (normal upcase) and #4 (filename upcase).
NLSFUNC even can re-use the data loaded via COUNTRY= and the hardcoded data.

4) The problem is that even without point 3) it is not easily possible to
pre-judge how many bytes the NLS pkg will allocate in memory, because
this NLS implementation wants to support a wider range of NLS pkgs; because
neither the number of subfunctions nor the size of the data per subfunction
is fixed globally.
Therefore, the package is built-up incrementally:
4.1) First all function definition structures (S3) are read into memory.
While doing so the position field is transformed into the absolute
position within COUNTRY.SYS.
4.2) Then they are checked if a subfunction is defined more than once.
4.3) Then the entries are sorted in that way that tables 0x23, 1, 2, 4 and 5
lead the table in that order.
4.4) Then the basic nlsPackage with as many entries within nlsPointers[]
is allocated as there are function definitions left (minus one as the
pseudo-table 0x23 does not require an entry).
4.5) Pseudo-table 0x23 is installed.
4.6) Table 1 is installed at the very end of the nlsPointers[] array.
4.7) In the order all remaining function definitions are installed in
the same order as in the other array.

5) "Installing" means (except table 0x23):
5.1) Enlarge the nlsPackage structure to hold the necessary bytes of the
function definition (member csys_length).
5.2) Only if NLS_MODIFYABLE_DATA is _not_ defined and table is not #1:
The loaded data is compared to already loaded data and if such pattern is
already found in memory, a pointer to that memory area is used and the
loaded data is discarded.
First the local data is searched through, then the area of the hardcoded
NLS pkg.
Efficiency: function definitions with the same file position can automatically
use the same memory area.

6) When all function definitions are loaded, the nlsPackage structure is
tightly filled without any pad bytes; two areas are wasted:
a) The area containing the S3 structures, and
b) probably the last loaded data could be found within the memory already,
so the nlsPackage structure is larger than necessary.

8) But the memory allocation in pass 1 is temporary anyway, because in
the PostConfig() phase, all memory allocations are revoked and created
anew. At this point -- immediately after revoking all memory and
_before_ allocating any new memory -- the NLS pkg is located completely
within memory and one knows exactly which bytes to spare, and which data
can share the same physical memory; but if the normal PostConfig()
process would go on, this information would be lost, because it could be
overwritten.
==> Therefore the almost first operation within PostConfig() is to
move the NLS pkg upto the top (base?) of memory, thus, making sure
it is not overwritten and one need not re-load all the structures from
memory and, by doing so, loose the information which memory can be shared.

9) Once this operation has been completed, the NLS pkg is joined into the
nlsInfo chain of loaded packages and is made active.

===

To ease implementation the value of FP_SEG(nlsPointers[].pointer) != 0,
if the pointer refers to an absolute place, whereas FP_SEG() == 0,
indicates that the FP_OFF(...) is the offset base-relative to the data
offset; which is base-relative to the "nls" pointer.
