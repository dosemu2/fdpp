
Thanks to Bart Oldeman for helping us with moving the FreeDOS source code
from CVS to Subversion! The old CVS repository is still available for
browsing, but will no longer be used for managing FreeDOS Projects - and
will probably be deleted later. Please use Subversion for the FreeDOS
kernel, FreeCOM (FreeDOS command.com), Install, and Mem.

Bart has also written a Subversion at SourceForge Mini How-to:

This information was mostly lifted from SourceForge.net:
https://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id

FreeDOS Subversion:

Subversion (SVN) is a tool used by many software developers to manage
changes within their source code tree. SVN provides the means to store not
only the current version of a piece of source code, but a record of all
changes (and who made those changes) that have occurred to that source code.
Use of SVN is particularly common on projects with multiple developers,
since SVN ensures changes made by one developer are not accidentally removed
when another developer posts their changes to the source tree.

In order to access a Subversion repository, you must install a special piece
of software called a Subversion client. Subversion clients are available for
most any operating system.

To get a working copy, do svn co URL freedos where URL is the complete path
to the trunk of the project you want. For example:

FreeDOS kernel
  https://freedos.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freedos/kernel/trunk
FreeDOS FreeCOM
  https://freedos.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freedos/freecom/trunk
FreeDOS MEM
  https://freedos.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freedos/mem/trunk
FreeDOS Install
  https://freedos.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freedos/install/trunk

Be careful NOT to use the top level
  * https://freedos.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freedos URL
instead of one of the trunk URLs. This will pull all modules, tags and/or
branches of the project - it will be huge. Instead, you will want to use
/trunk to the URL to check out only the trunk code (main development line).

Though Subversion repositories are most commonly accessed using a special
piece of software called a Subversion client, SourceForge also provides a
web-based interface to view Subversion repositories. Browsing the Subversion
tree gives you a great view into the current status of this project's code.
You may also view the complete history of any file in the repository.

Note: Readonly access via the old CVS interface worked as follows:
To check out the code, first log in:
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.freedos.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/freedos login
Password: Press the Enter key.
Then, to get the kernel code:
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.freedos.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/freedos checkout kernel
